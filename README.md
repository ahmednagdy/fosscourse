# Gaussian Elimimation

## What it does

This is a **C# console app** that solves a system of linear equations step by step using *Gaussian Elimination* approach and illustrating steps in the process.

## Current Version
The current version is v3. The changelog from the previous version includes:

 - Improving the app architecture.
 - Several bug fixes and improvements.
 ## How to setup
 It is a single portable `.exe` file. You can download it [here](http://bit.ly/2tAxIkK).

## How to use

 1. First, the app will ask you for the size of the Augmented matrix of the system in `n*m` format.
 2. Next, it will ask you for the elements of the matrix. You should enter them row by row leaving a space between each element. Press Enter key to move to the next row.
 3. When you finish, if there is no errors, it should print the linear system and wait for your input to procceed with the solution.
